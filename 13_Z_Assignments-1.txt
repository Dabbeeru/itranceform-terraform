Create Ghost module
Create a directory called ghost.
Your modules will be made up of three files: main.tf, variables.tf and outputs.tf.

main.tf
In main.tf you will deploy out two resources docker_image and docker_container. The docker_image resource name will be ghost_image.
The name will use th image_name variable.
The docker_container resource name will be ghost_container.
The name will be set using a varialbe called container_name. The image will be set usingdocker_image.ghost_image.latest. Set the external port to use the ext_port variable.

variables.tf
In variables.tf create three varialbes: image_name, container_name and ext_port.

outputs.tf
In outputs.tf create two outputs: ip and container_name. The ip output the ghost_container's ip_address attribute.
The container_name output the ghost_container's name attribute.

Create root module
main.tf
In cloud_user directory create main.tf, variables.tf and outputs.tf. In main.tf will use the ghost module.
Set image_name using a variable called image_name.
Set container_name using a variable called container_name.
Set ext_port using a variable called ext_port.
In variables.tf create three image_name, container_name and ext_port.

variables.tf
The image_name will have a default value of ghost:latest with a description of Image for container.
The container_name will have a default value of blogwith a description ofName of the container.  
Theext_portwill have adefaultvalue of 80 with a description of External port for container.

outputs.tf
In outputs.tf create two outputs: ip and container_name. The ip output the ghost_container's ip_address attribute.
The container_name output the ghost_container's name attribute.

Deploy the infrastructure
Initialize Terraform.
Generate a Terraform plan and output a plan file.
Deploy the infrastructure using the plan file.

[root@ip-172-31-9-125 container]# cat main.tf
# Start the Container
resource "docker_container" "container_id" {
  name  = "${var.container_name}"
  image = "${var.image}"
  ports {
    internal = "${var.int_port}"
    external = "${var.ext_port}"
  }
}
[root@ip-172-31-9-125 container]# cat variables.tf
#Define variables
variable "container_name" {}
variable "image" {}
variable "int_port" {}
variable "ext_port" {}
[root@ip-172-31-9-125 container]# cat outputs.tf
#Output the IP Address of the Container
output "ip" {
  value = "${docker_container.container_id.ip_address}"
}

output "container_name" {
  value = "${docker_container.container_id.name}"
}

 terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of terraform-providers/docker...
- Installing terraform-providers/docker v2.7.2...
- Installed terraform-providers/docker v2.7.2 (signed by HashiCorp)

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

* terraform-providers/docker: version = "~> 2.7.2"


Warning: Interpolation-only expressions are deprecated

  on main.tf line 3, in resource "docker_container" "container_id":
   3:   name  = "${var.container_name}"

Terraform 0.11 and earlier required all non-constant expressions to be
provided via interpolation syntax, but this pattern is now deprecated. To
silence this warning, remove the "${ sequence from the start and the }"
sequence from the end of this expression, leaving just the inner expression.

Template interpolation syntax is still used to construct strings from
expressions when the template includes multiple interpolation sequences or a
mixture of literal strings and interpolations. This deprecation applies only
to templates that consist entirely of a single interpolation sequence.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
[root@ip-172-31-9-125 container]# terraform plan -out=tfplan -var 'container_name=blog' -var 'image=ghost:alpine' -var 'int_port=2368' -var 'ext_port=80'
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "tfplan"
